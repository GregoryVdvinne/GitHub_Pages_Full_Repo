  title: "Gregory Vander Vinne's Personal Website"

Hello. My name is Gregory Vander Vinne. I analyze data and policies for a living in Edmonton, Canada. In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills related to data visualization, causal inference and all things data. I also enjoy playing and watching sports, especially soccer (football). A lot of the things I post here combine my interest in data analysis with my interest in sports.   

I decided to create a website so that I can share some of the things I create with others. I hope that some people can enjoy reading my posts almost as much as I enjoy making them.
