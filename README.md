# GitHub Pages Full Repo

This repo contains all of the files used to create my github pages website. The repo that creates the actual site contains only the files from the _site/ folder of this repo. Files are copied from this folder over to the actual GitHub Pages site repo for deployment.  

Currently I am having an issue pushing commits in this repo to GitHub. This line is to test.
